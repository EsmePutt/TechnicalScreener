# Story Park Technical Screener

This Repository contains four .java files:

1. A class responsible for flattening any arbitrarily nested array
2. A suite of JUnit tests designed to test the array flattener class
3. A class responsible for parsing a JSON file and storing the staff members living within a certain distance of a specified location, as well as printing the staff members to the console
4. A suite of JUnit tests designed to test the parser

It also contains other files necessary to complete the tests (i.e an empty .JSON file and an incorrectly formatted .JSON file)

# Technical Article:

The most interested article I have read recently is titled ‘No classification without Representation: Assessing Geodiversity Issues in Open Data Sets for the Developing world’. I first stumbled upon this article as it was linked from Google’s AI blog. Whilst I usually follow this blog to gain more technical knowledge of AI concepts, I think this article is incredibly important as it highlights some of the very real challenges within emerging technology. Whilst I believe technology has immense power to do social good, I also think it is really important to keep questioning where it can also neglect those with less power. 

This article also reminds me of how many blind spots I personally hold, and the constant need for humility and curiosity when learning something new.  As someone who is not personally a part of the ‘developing world’, the lack of Geodiversity in AI data sets is not something I had personally considered as an issue. Reading it was a good reminder that, to develop good technology, I must not just have good intentions, but must constantly seek to keep learning from the perspectives of others’. 

Although this article is about AI, I believe that anyone interested in developing technology for social good should read it. It highlights the need for diverse voices and critical thinking when approaching any technological challenge.
